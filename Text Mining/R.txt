About The R Journal

The R Journal is the open access, refereed journal of the R project for statistical computing. It features short to medium length articles covering topics that might be of interest to users or developers of R, including
Add-on packages:
short introductions to R extension packages.
Programmer's Niche:
hints for programming in R.
Help Desk:
hints for newcomers explaining aspects of R that might not be so obvious from reading the manuals and FAQs.
Applications:
demonstrating how a new or existing technique can be applied in an area of current interest using R, providing a fresh view of such analyses in R that is of benefit beyond the specific application.
The R Journal intends to reach a wide audience and have a fast-track but thorough review process. Papers are expected to be reasonably short, clearly written, not too technical, and of course focused on R. Authors of refereed articles should take care to:

put their contribution in context, in particular discuss related R functions or packages;
explain the motivation for their contribution;
provide code examples that are reproducible.
Continuing from R News, The R Journal also has a news section, including information on:

Changes in R:
new features of the latest release.
Changes on CRAN:
new add-on packages, manuals, binary distributions, mirrors,...
Upcoming conferences:
announcements of conferences related to R.
Conference reports:
